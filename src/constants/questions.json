    "question": "Evaluate the definite integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\sin(x) + \\cos(x)} dx$. Show your work and explain the steps, including any substitutions or identities used.",
    "hint": "Consider the substitution $u = \\tan(x/2)$, known as the Weierstrass substitution, to simplify the integrand.",
    "answer": "Using the Weierstrass substitution $u = \\tan(x/2)$, we transform the integral into a rational function, which evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ after careful computation."

    "question": "Find the derivative of $f(x) = \\sin^{-1}(x^2)$ with respect to $x$. Then, evaluate the derivative at $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Explain your steps, including the use of the chain rule.",
    "hint": "Use the chain rule and the derivative of the inverse sine function: $\\frac{d}{dx} \\sin^{-1}(u) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-u^2}} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx}$.",
    "answer": "The derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{1-(x^2)^2}}$. At $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, this evaluates to $f'\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4}} = 2$."

    "question": "Evaluate the limit $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{x - \\sin(x)}{x^3}$. Explain why this is an indeterminate form and use an appropriate method to solve it.",
    "hint": "This is a $0/0$ indeterminate form. Consider using L'Hôpital's Rule or the Taylor series expansion of $\\sin(x)$.",
    "answer": "Using the Taylor series for $\\sin(x) \\approx x - \\frac{x^3}{6}$, the limit becomes $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{x - (x - \\frac{x^3}{6})}{x^3} = \\frac{1}{6}$. Alternatively, L'Hôpital's Rule applied three times yields the same result."

    "question": "There are 10 chameleons: 4 red, 3 blue, and 3 green. When two chameleons of different colors meet, they both change to the third color (e.g., a red and a blue chameleon both become green). Can you make all chameleons the same color through a series of meetings? Explain your reasoning.",
    "hint": "Consider the parity of the number of chameleons of each color and how it changes with each meeting.",
    "answer": "No, it’s impossible. Each meeting changes the counts of two colors by -1 and the third by +2, preserving the parity of the counts modulo 3. Initially, the counts (4, 3, 3) are (1, 0, 0) mod 3, but to have all chameleons the same color (e.g., 10 red), the counts must be (10, 0, 0), which is (1, 0, 0) mod 3 for red but requires adjusting other parities, which is not possible."

You pick a coin at random and flip it 3 times, getting heads each time. What is the probability that you picked the two-headed coin? Show your work using Bayes’ theorem.",
    "hint": "Use Bayes’ theorem: $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$, where $A$ is picking the two-headed coin, and $B$ is getting 3 heads.",
    "answer": "Using Bayes’ theorem, the probability is $\\frac{P(\\text{3 heads | two-headed})P(\\text{two-headed})}{P(\\text{3 heads})} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}}{1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{8}{81} + \\frac{1}{24}} = \\frac{36}{53}$."

What is the probability that the other coin in the same box is also gold? Explain using conditional probability.",
    "hint": "Consider the conditional probability of picking the box with two gold coins given that the first coin drawn is gold.",
    "answer": "The probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$. There are 6 coins total (3 gold, 3 silver). Drawing a gold coin means you picked either the gold-gold box (2 gold coins) or the gold-silver box (1 gold coin). The probability of having picked the gold-gold box given a gold coin is drawn is $\\frac{2/6}{2/6 + 1/6} = \\frac{2}{3}$."
