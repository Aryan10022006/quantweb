    "question": "Find the derivative of the function $f(x) = \\sin(x)$. Explain why the derivative of sine is cosine using the limit definition.",
    "hint": "Use the limit definition of derivative: $f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$",
    "answer": "The derivative of $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ is $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$. This can be proven using the limit definition of derivative and trigonometric identities."

    "question": "Evaluate the limit $\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$. This is a fundamental limit in calculus. Explain why this limit is important and how it relates to the derivative of sine.",
    "hint": "Consider using the Squeeze Theorem or Taylor series expansion of $\\sin(x)$.",
    "answer": "$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1$. This limit is crucial because it helps us find the derivative of sine and is used in many other trigonometric limits."
